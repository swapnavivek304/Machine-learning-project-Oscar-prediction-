# Machine-learning-project: Oscar-prediction
  # Project Aim
 Based on historical data, predict if a movie would win Oscar Award. 

  # ML Model Developed
 Logistic regression model

  # Description
 The dataset was first undergone through data cleansing process after which a logistic regression model was developed to train the dataset.\
 Different variables were tried first to train the model before deciding the most appropriate variable.\ First the model was developed with 
 an accuracy of 56.8% with K neighbours classifiers=1. The model was further improved to obtain greater accuracy. An improved model with greater accuracy
 of 57.8% could be developed with 4 K neighbours classifiers.
 
  # Skills
 Python, Jupyter Notebook, sklearn, pandas, numpy, matplotlib, machine learning, model development, data cleansing, data transformation.
